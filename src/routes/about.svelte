<h1>FAQ</h1>

<h2>Does this really split the universe?</h2>

<p>First, this all depends on the Everett (or Many Worlds) Intepretation of Quantum Mechanics.</p>

<p>For an introduction, I recommend David Deutsch's the Fabric of Reality.</p>

<p>I am not a physicist! This is all my interpretation. I love talking about this shit so please tell me if I got it wrong!</p>

<p>That said: technically the universe is already split into the relevant parts when the number is generated. This website just elevates that
to the level of something meaninful to you so you can decide to do different things in different universes.</p>

<p>Which universe do you end up in? You can't know ahead of time. This is called "self-locating uncertainty".</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

<p>Full details TBD</p>

    I plan to also make the server-side code available but for now it's just in a CloudFlare worker.

<p>This website uses a true source of quantum randomness provided by 
an API from the Australian National University.</p>
