<h1>FAQ</h1>

<h2>Does this really split the universe?</h2>

<p>First, this all depends on the Everett (or Many Worlds) Intepretation of Quantum Mechanics.</p>

<p>For an introduction, I recommend David Deutsch's the Fabric of Reality.</p>

<p><b>I am not a physicist!</b> This is all my interpretation. I love talking about this shit so please tell me if I got it wrong!

    (<a href="https://github.com/semistrict/freeuniversesplitter.com">fork on GitHub</a>).
</p>

<p>That said: technically the universe is already split into the relevant parts when the number is generated. This website just elevates that
to the level of something meaninful to you so you can decide to do different things in different universes.</p>

<p>Which universe do you end up in? You can't know ahead of time. This is called "self-locating uncertainty".</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

<p>
    Full details but basically it just invokes a quantum random number generator.
    My understanding is that this number will be different in every universe.

<p><a href="https://github.com/semistrict/freeuniversesplitter.com">UI is here on GitHub</a>
    I plan to also make the server-side code available but for now it's just in a CloudFlare worker.
</p>

<p>This website uses a true source of quantum randomness provided by 
an API from the Australian National University.</p>

<h2>
    None of this is realy how it works
</h2>

<p>
    When I use words like "unverse", "split" etc. this is all an approximation for what's really going on 
    which doesn't really have an analogue in everyday language. 
</p>
<p>
    But to a first approximation, it is kind of like there are multiple classical universes 
    that split and from your perspective (pre-split)
    you can think of the probabilities as the chance of you ending up in each branch.
</p>
<p>
    Of course there are no universes, there is no "you", there's just wave function.
</p>

<h2>
    Is the Evertt Interpratation correct?
</h2>

<p>
    I think it is and I think a majority of physicists who work in relevant fields now agree on this (citation needed).
</p>

<p>
    For many years we suffered under the Copenhagen Interpretation. That's probably the one you've heard of.
    It makes quantum mechanics harder to understand because its basically incoherent.
</p>

<h2>How is this different from a coin toss?</h2>

<p>
    When you toss a coin the outcome is actually pretty easy to deterimine if you know the exact position and
    forces involved. Another way to say this is that the coin always lands in the same position in all 
    universes (that branched off the start of the coin flip).
</p>

<p>
    Quantum randmess is truly random: unpredictable in principle. But this "randomness" is really just 
    an instance of self-locating uncertainty. QM under Everett is totally deterministic. These statements can all be true, apparently.
